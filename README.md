# Semantic-based-automatic-web-service-check-detection

Many web services do not have explicit associated semantic descriptions. Therefore, implemented a prototype for semantic-based service categorization of web services and enhancement of service requests.
Initiated the ontology framework as a solution, with that implemented algorithms such as support vector machine, prune association patterns, and mapping for achieving the desired task.
